long-description:  These are results of football games in England and Wales from the Premier League in the season 2013/2014, in form of a directed, signed graph.  Nodes are teams, and each directed edge from A to B denotes that team A played at home against team B.  The edge weights are the goal difference, and thus positive if the home team wins, negative when the away team wins, and zero for a draw.  The exact game results are not represented; only the goal differences are.  The data was copied by hand from Wikipedia.
